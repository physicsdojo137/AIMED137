        "Tutorial: Using Medgemma as a prototype AI Clinical Scribe.AI clinical scribes are emerging technologies that leverage natural language processing and machine learning to automatically listen to and transcribe patient-clinician conversations, converting them into structured medical notes for electronic health records (EHRs). Their primary aim is to alleviate the significant administrative burden on healthcare providers, freeing them from extensive data entry to focus more on direct patient care and interaction. By automating documentation, these AI tools promise to reduce clinician burnout, improve the efficiency of clinical workflows, and potentially enhance the accuracy and completeness of medical records, ultimately aiming to improve the overall quality of patient encounters.\n",

        "Patient Hi Doctor. It's my throat. It's… it's been killing me for the last few days, but today it's just unbearable.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Okay, tell me more about it. When did it start?\n",
        "Patient: Uh, maybe four days ago? It started just like a regular sore throat, scratchy. I figured it was a cold. But it's gotten progressively worse, especially the last 24-48 hours. The pain is… intense.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate it right now?\n",
        "Patient: Honestly, like a 9. Especially when I try to swallow.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: And is the pain localized to one side, or all over?\n",
        "Patient: It feels much worse on the left side. Like, deep in there.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Any trouble swallowing? Food? Liquids? Even your own saliva?\n",
        "Patient: Yeah, all of it. Swallowing saliva is agony. I’ve barely eaten anything today. I’m kind of… drooling a bit because it hurts so much to swallow. It’s embarrassing.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Not embarrassing at all, Mr. Miller. It just tells me how much discomfort you're in. Have you noticed any change in your voice?\n",
        "Patient: My wife said I sound funny.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Any fever, chills, body aches?\n",
        "Patient: Yeah, I felt really hot last night, definitely had a fever. Took some ibuprofen. Maybe some mild body aches, but the throat is the main thing.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Have you tried any other remedies? Lozenges, sprays?\n",
        "Patient: Lozenges don't touch it. Salt water gargle felt like fire.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Any difficulty opening your mouth wide?\n",
        "Patient: Yeah, it’s a bit stiff. Doesn’t want to open all the way.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Okay. Any history of recurrent tonsillitis or similar severe sore throats?\n",
        "Patient: I used to get strep a lot as a kid, but nothing like this as an adult.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Any allergies to medications?\n",
        "Patient: Penicillin. I get a rash.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Good to know. Any other medical conditions? Are you a smoker?\n",
        "Patient: No other conditions. I vape, but I haven't been able to the last couple of days.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Okay, Mr. Miller. I'm going to take a look. I'll also check your vital signs.Temp 38.9°C, HR 110, BP 130/80, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Your temperature is up, and your heart rate is a bit fast, which is common with pain and infection. Okay, let’s have a look in your throat. Can you open as wide as you can for me? Say \"Ahhh.\"\n",
        "Patient:Arrr…\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Okay, just relax your tongue. Hmm. Yes, I see. There’s significant swelling on the left side, around your tonsil. The tonsil itself is very red and pushed towards the midline. Your uvula, that little punching bag thing in the back, is deviated over to the right. That whole left peritonsillar area looks very angry and full.\n",
        "Patient: Is it bad?\n",
        "Dr. Carter: It looks like you have what we call a peritonsillar abscess, Mr. Miller. That means there's a collection of pus that has formed in the tissues next to your tonsil. That explains the severe one-sided pain, the difficulty swallowing, the change in your voice, and the trouble opening your mouth – that’s called trismus.\n",
        "Patient: An abscess? Like… pus? Oh man. What does that mean? Do I need surgery?\n",
        "Dr. Carter: It means we need to get that pus out. The standard treatment is to drain it. Sometimes this can be done with a needle aspiration or a small incision. Given the extent of it and your symptoms, this is something that typically needs to be handled by an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist (ENT).\n",
        "Patient: So, what happens now?\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Here’s the plan:\n",
        "We need to get you some immediate relief and start treating the infection. I’m going to give you an IV. Through that, we'll give you a strong antibiotic – since you're allergic to penicillin, we'll use something like Clindamycin.\n",
        "We’ll also give you some IV steroids to help with the swelling, and some IV pain medication to make you more comfortable.\n",
        "I'm going to call the on-call ENT specialist at University Hospital right now. They will likely want to see you in the Emergency Department there to evaluate you for drainage. This isn't something we typically drain here in urgent care when it's this significant.\n",
        "Patient: University Hospital? So I have to go to the ED?\n",
        "Dr. Carter: Yes, that's the safest and best place for this to be managed. They have the specialized equipment and expertise. We'll get you started on treatment here to make the transfer more comfortable and to get a head start on the infection. The main thing is to get that abscess drained to provide relief and prevent complications.\n",
        "Patient:Okay. Wow. I didn't think a sore throat could get this bad.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: It's not a simple sore throat anymore, unfortunately. The good news is that once it's drained, patients usually feel a significant improvement in pain very quickly. Do you have any questions for me right now?\n",
        "Patient: Um… will it hurt when they drain it?\n",
        "Dr. Carter: They will numb the area very well before they do anything. You'll feel pressure, but it shouldn't be sharply painful. And the relief afterwards is usually substantial. We'll get your IV started, get those medications in, and I'll get on the phone with ENT. We'll get you sorted out.\n",
        "Patient: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.\n",
        "Dr. Carter: You're welcome, Mr. Miller.\n",
